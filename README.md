# Forage
## Never be lost again

Forage is the result of [Serena Ngai](https://github.com/serenangai) and [Edward Ocampo-Gooding](https://github.com/edward) being asked “ohai, I’m looking for a place to (eat|drink|have fun) near the office – know anywhere?”

Authors include: [Serena Ngai](https://github.com/serenangai) (design!), [Edward Ocampo-Gooding](https://github.com/edward) (code!), [Ian Mortier](https://github.com/healthcare) (design!), [Kevin McPhillips](https://github.com/kmcphillips) (code!), [Chris Lobay](https://github.com/christopherlobay) (design!), [Brittany Forsyth](https://github.com/BrittanyForsyth) (places!), [Courtney Symons](https://github.com/CourtneySymons) (places!), [Lisa Danay](https://github.com/BrittanyForsyth) (places!), and [everyone else who we collaboratively roped in](https://github.com/edward/forage/graphs/contributors) to help out (love!).

## Future Features

* Speeeeeed – this thing feels pretty slow; moar caching and possibly using a redis back for the tags could help, but we haven’t really started looking at where the slow parts are
* Easier contributions of places + curating those suggestions
* Fave stars for places + feedback to those who suggested the place that got the fave
